# Verse.MoonWorks

Library for hooking up SDL3 with Verse.Core. Based on [MoonWorks](https://github.com/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks). This is
our fundamental windowing and graphics library, so most other projects depend on it.

Does not provide any extended layers on top of SDL3. It is a low-level library that provides the basic interop.
